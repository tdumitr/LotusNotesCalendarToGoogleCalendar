# LotusNotesCalendarToGoogleCalendar

The intended goal of this project is to allow synchronizing a local Lotus Notes calendar database with a Google Calendar. The synch will be both ways.

The project will meet my personal needs. If you find it useful, I am glad. I cannot promise to support any feature requests. I am working on the project on my own, personal time and I might stop at any time. 

Please do not change the repository until v1 is ready. Until then, this is a solo project. The functionality will not be complete and your changes will throw me off, chasing your code and figuring out how it will work.
